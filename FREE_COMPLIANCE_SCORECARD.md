## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Frontend Assessment Form**
```javascript
// Assessment Form Component
const ComplianceAssessment = () => {
  const [currentQuestion, setCurrentQuestion] = useState(0);
  const [answers, setAnswers] = useState({});
  const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState({});
  
  const questions = [
    // Questions array from scorecard structure
  ];
  
  const calculateScore = () => {
    let totalScore = 0;
    Object.values(answers).forEach(score => {
      totalScore += score;
    });
    return totalScore;
  };
  
  const generateReport = () => {
    const score = calculateScore();
    const riskLevel = getRiskLevel(score);
    const recommendations = getRecommendations(riskLevel);
    
    return {
      score,
      riskLevel,
      recommendations,
      penaltyRisk: calculatePenaltyRisk(answers),
      urgentActions: getUrgentActions(answers)
    };
  };
};
```

### **Lead Capture Integration**
```javascript
// Lead capture and WhatsApp integration
const submitAssessment = async (assessmentData) => {
  try {
    // Save lead to database
    const leadId = await saveLeadData({
      ...userInfo,
      assessmentScore: assessmentData.score,
      riskLevel: assessmentData.riskLevel,
      source: 'compliance_scorecard',
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    // Send WhatsApp message
    await sendWhatsAppMessage({
      to: userInfo.phone,
      template: 'scorecard_results',
      data: assessmentData
    });
    
    // Trigger follow-up sequence
    await scheduleFollowUps(leadId, assessmentData.riskLevel);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Assessment submission failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### **WhatsApp Integration**
```javascript
// Automated WhatsApp follow-up sequence
const scorecardFollowUpTemplates = {
  immediate: {
    high_risk: "🚨 URGENT: Your compliance score shows ₹{penalty_risk} penalty risk. Can we schedule a 10-minute call today to discuss protection options?",
    medium_risk: "⚠️ Your compliance needs attention. I've identified {gap_count} issues that could result in ₹{penalty_risk} penalties. Ready to fix these?",
